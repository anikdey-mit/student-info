---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the Django application on macOS, we need to create virtual environment. Then it we need to activate the virtual environment by running the following command :

                                        $ source bin/activate


Django application will start by running the following command:

                                        $ python manage.py runserver
                                        
In the local server, the application will run on port 8000.
